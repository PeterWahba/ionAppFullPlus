If you don't have an ionic app created, create one, by running the following command on the command console, on the folder you want your app to be created, 
once your app is created locate the pages folder and copy this component (folder) in the page folder:

$ ionic start MyAppName blank

Once you have your app created Install the components dependencies (see what is imported on the ts files on this component)

See instruction to instal image gallery: http://jomendez.com/ionAppFullPlus-documentation/#!/image_gallery

See documentation to configure firebase: http://jomendez.com/ionAppFullPlus-documentation/#!/firebase_configuration

This component uses the photo gallery included with this starter, to get the images from the gallery to process it with azure, 
but if you like you can use only the input for the image url.

Plugins and dependencies:
Copy the image gallery component to your application and follow the instructions on the intructions.txt file included in the gallery component.


Notes:
For this component to work you need to setup firebase and also import the DatabaseProvider from "/providers/database/database" included on the ionAppFullPlus project.
Also copy src/config/config.ts from this project (ionAppFullPlus) to your application, and enter your firebase information.
Also this feature need the user to be logged in, we recomend to use the login component included in this starter
