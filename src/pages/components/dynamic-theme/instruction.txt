Instructions to import this component into your ionic app:

For this component to work you'll need the providers/theme-manager/theme-manager.ts provider

If you want this dynamic theming to be appied to the entier app, you'll need to call getActiveTheme() in your src/app/app.component.ts constructor from the provider, like this:

this.themeManager.getActiveTheme().subscribe(val => this.selectedTheme = val);

then go to src/app/app.html add [class]="selectedTheme", like this:
<ion-nav [root]="rootPage" [class]="selectedTheme"></ion-nav>


To modify the styles:
Go to src/theme and modify the dark.theme.scss and light.theme.scss files. Copy them into your application's theme folder

Also import these files into your src/theme/variables.scss file, like this:
@import "light.theme";
@import "dark.theme";
