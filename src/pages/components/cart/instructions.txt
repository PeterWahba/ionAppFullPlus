If you don't have an ionic app created, create one, by running the following command on the command console, on the folder you want your app to be created, 
once your app is created locate the pages folder and copy this component (folder) in the page folder:

$ ionic start MyAppName blank

for more info go to the ionic official documentation.


Once you have your app created:
-Install the cordoba plugin and ionic native wrapper:

$ ionic cordova plugin add com.paypal.cordova.mobilesdk
$ npm install --save @ionic-native/paypal

more info here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/paypal/

$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-stripe
& npm install @ionic-native/stripe


-Go to your app.modules.ts and import PayPal, and register it withing the providers array, 

import { PayPal } from '@ionic-native/paypal';
import { Stripe } from '@ionic-native/stripe';
 
 providers: [
    ...
    PayPal,
    Stripe,
	...
	]

Notes:
For this component to work you need to setup firebase and also import the DatabaseProvider from "/providers/database/database" included on the ionAppFullPlus project.
Also copy src/config/config.ts from this project (ionAppFullPlus) to your application, and enter your firebase information.
