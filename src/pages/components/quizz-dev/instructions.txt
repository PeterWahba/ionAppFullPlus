Instructions to import this component in your existing ionic app.

If you don't have an ionic app created, create one, by running the following command on the command console, on the folder you want your app to be created, 
once your app is created locate the pages folder and copy this component (folder) in the page folder:

$ ionic start MyAppName blank

for more info go to the ionic official documentation.


Once you have your app created Install the components dependencies (see what is imported on the ts files on this component):
npm install --save js-beautify
npm install --save left-pad
npm install --save moment
npm install --save pouchdb
npm install --save prismjs
npm install --save rxjs
npm install --save firebase
npm install --save angularfire2

You'll also need to copy the following files from this starter to your project:
./config/config.ts
./assets/data
./components/quizzer
./pipes/safe/safe.ts
./providers/quiz
./providers/auth-data.ts
./theme/prismjs.scss
./theme/quizz.core.scss
./theme/variables.scss

For this component to work you need to setup firebase and also import the DatabaseProvider from "/providers/database/database" included on the ionAppFullPlus project.
Config your firebase application to support authentication as explained in the documentation included with this starter.
